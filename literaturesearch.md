## How to search for papers
###	Use Google Scholar
  -	Searching with keywords always helps
    -Get new papers of your field of research Set alerts using the key words.
###	Use Arxiv (does not apply to all students)
  -	Not all areas of research use this, but mostly CS, Physics researchers upload unpublished papers on Arxiv.
  -	Those who are doing ML research may find Arxiv useful.
